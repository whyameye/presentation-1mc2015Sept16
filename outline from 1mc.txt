Your presentation should be no longer than six minutes in length. In your presentation, please make sure you include your background, how/why you got started and information about your product/service. It is supposed to be about your entrepreneurial journey and not a sales pitch. Below is a suggestion of how you should use your time to talk about your company/product/endeavor before you get insights from the audience. 

Minute 1 - Backstory & Credibility Builder 
Minute 2 - Identification of Problem in the Market 
Minute 3 - Intro of Product & How it Provides a Solution in the Market 
Minute 4 - Identification of Customers & Competition 
Minute 5 - Why Product is Different than all Competitors & What the Functional or Conceptual Competitive Advantage is 
Minute 6 - Identification of Problems Facing the Go To Market Strategy & Next Steps 

Once your presentation is finished, we will open the Q&A portion of the program first to the expert panel and then to the audience. The Q&A portion lasts for approximately 20 minutes. Also at the end of the Q&A, one of the 1MC organizers will ask you "What can the community do to help you?" I would add an additional slide to your presentation that answers this question. Please ask direct help from the audience such as I am looking for a marketing person, help with social media, advice on funding, etc instead of just asking for awareness in social media. This is your chance for some great guidance from audience members and a way for you to get know more of the 1MC community around you. 

Please note that the Kauffman Foundation, where our event is held, is a non profit and any for profit activity could jeopardize the status of the foundation. For instance, you can say that "my product is on sale at these locations" instead of "you can purchase my product here after my presentation." You cannot directly ask for an investment from the crowd nor ask for support of a crowdfunding campaign.
